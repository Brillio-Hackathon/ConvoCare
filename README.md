An app that tracks the mood of the user

The aim of our project is to promote human interaction with the help of AI and provide a stable and secure platform for people to vent out their frustrations, or celebrate their personal joys in an anonymous manner. 
* Our app monitors and tracks the mood of the user based on certain psychological activities that are done on the app which are run through sentiment analysis and other classifier models.
* The app then connects users on the basis of the similarity algorithms which would help the users further establish empathy and provide catharsis for the users.
* The app also tracks and provides the user with statistics and summaries with the help of GenAI on their behavioral insights and moods and further gives tips on health and well-being that are personalized to the user.
* The users also have access to mental health experts on the app which helps enhance 
accessibility for the users.
